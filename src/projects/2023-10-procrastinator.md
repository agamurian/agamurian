# Procrastinator  
*(original name: “Questions”)*

This is an inter-medium artwork, a meta-procrastination piece for people too lazy to procrastinate themselves.

A simple script emulates keypresses and launches client-side programs. It mainly asks abstract questions about life inside those programs: in the terminal, in the browser on different websites. It browses Google and plays piano in an emulator, creating a meta-immersive experience with sound and video that depends on real-time internet data and is different every time the script runs.

This work is very poetic and personal. For example, it includes the question “why there are so many butterflies.” At the time of its creation, during the summer of 2018, the author was inexplicably bombarded by moths and butterflies through a room window. Even such personal and detailed questions work well within this abstract narrative.

The project also uses the popular tiling window manager i3 and a riced Linux distribution to reflect a soothing, nerdy environment.

The timing is roughly 7 minutes. It starts slow and shy and intensifies toward the end, with rapid electronic music and loud text-to-speech read aloud via Google Translator.

This artwork was created during the author’s student years at the Rodchenko Art School.
