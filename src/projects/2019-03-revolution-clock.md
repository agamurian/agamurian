# Revolution Clock

An IoT device for a Russian government official to maintain balance.  
This project is a joke — a localization of the Doomsday Clock.

The clock is built using:
- NodeMCU Arduino chip  
- A real analog clock  
- A tiny internet server  

It connects to the internet and analyzes data from news, social media, and other sources to predict how close Russian society is to revolution. The Arduino chip controls the clock speed, from completely still to real-time movement. 00:00 represents revolution and the end of the current government.

The prediction basis is fetched from the internet:
1. Sechin’s salary  
2. Bread prices  
3. Reputation of the police  
4. Frequency of new laws  

Interesting fact: the resistor was made from a pencil, and the clock only worked at certain temperatures. Before the presentation, it had to be heated with a hair dryer.
