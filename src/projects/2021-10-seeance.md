# Seeance.icu

**Project by:**  
[Varavara Kuleshova](https://varvarakuleshova.com)

According to the author’s description, Seeance is a website through which you can view an animated 3D scan of the human body in augmented reality on a mobile device. The development uses Google AR.

My task was to bring the 3D scan into motion and optimize it for the web.

This is an art project. The idle animation is not extrapolated — the goal was to create realistic, detailed, barely noticeable movements of a body at rest.

Breathing, heartbeat, blinking, and subtle hand tremors together create an uncanny-valley-like effect unique to this project.

**What I did:**
- Optimization of models and textures  
- Adding missing parts (eyes, teeth, eyelashes)  
- Rigging  
- Animation  
- Export and compression  
- Testing and refinement  

Procedural animation was used extensively. With simple functions like sine and Perlin noise, a large number of organic movements can be achieved.
